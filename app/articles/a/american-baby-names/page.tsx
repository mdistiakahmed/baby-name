            2. Classic and Timeless Names
          </h2>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mt-4">
            Many American baby names are classic and timeless, passed down
            through generations. These names often have historical significance
            or literary connections, such as &quot;Elizabeth,&quot;
            &quot;William,&quot; &quot;Emily,&quot; or &quot;Alexander.&quot;
            They maintain popularity over decades, offering a sense of tradition
            and stability.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-4">
            3. Pop Culture Influences
          </h2>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mt-4">
            American pop culture, including movies, television, music, and
            celebrities, also heavily influences baby names. Names of famous
            actors, characters from beloved films and TV shows, and popular
            musicians often see spikes in popularity. Examples include
            &quot;Arya&quot; from &quot;Game of Thrones,&quot;
            &quot;Harper&quot; after Harper Lee, and &quot;Beyonc√©&quot; after
            the famous singer.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-4">
            4. Regional Variations
          </h2>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mt-4">
            The vast geographical and cultural diversity across the United
            States contributes to regional variations in baby names. Certain
            names may be more popular in specific regions due to cultural or
            linguistic influences. For instance, names with Spanish origins
            might be more prevalent in states with large Hispanic populations
            like California and Texas.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-4">
            5. Uniqueness and Creativity
          </h2>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mt-4">
            American parents often embrace creativity when choosing baby names.
            They may alter spellings, combine names, or invent completely new
            ones. This trend towards uniqueness allows parents to give their
            child a name that stands out while still being meaningful to them.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-4">
            6. Gender-Neutral Names
          </h2>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mt-4">
            Gender-neutral names are gaining popularity in the United States as
            parents seek names that aren&apos;t tied to traditional gender
            norms. Names like &quot;Jordan,&quot; &quot;Taylor,&quot;
            &quot;Sawyer,&quot; and &quot;Riley&quot; are chosen for their
            versatility and modern appeal, suitable for any child regardless of
            gender.

            reflect personal values. Names with positive attributes like
            &quot;Grace,&quot; &quot;Hope,&quot; &quot;Justice,&quot; or

            parents hope their children will embody.

            8. Ethnic and Cultural Pride
          </h2>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mt-4">
            Ethnic and cultural pride play a significant role in naming choices
            among American families. Names that honor cultural heritage, such as
            &quot;Mohammed,&quot; &quot;Lakshmi,&quot; &quot;Liam,&quot; or
            &quot;Makayla,&quot; celebrate diversity and connect children to
            their roots.
          </p>
