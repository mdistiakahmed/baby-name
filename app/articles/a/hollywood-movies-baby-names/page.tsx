          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-4">
            Classic Elegance
          </h2>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mt-4">
            Names like <strong>Audrey</strong>, <strong>Grace</strong>, and{" "}
            <strong>Elizabeth</strong> evoke a sense of timeless elegance on
            screen. Think of <strong>Audrey Hepburn</strong> in{" "}
            <strong>&quot;Breakfast at Tiffanys,&quot;</strong> embodying
            sophistication with her character Holly Golightly. Similarly, the
            regal grace of names like <strong>Grace (Kelly)</strong>
            and <strong>Elizabeth (Taylor)</strong> has left an indelible mark
            on Hollywood&apos;s history.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-4">
            Iconic Strength
          </h2>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mt-4">
            Certain names carry an inherent strength and resilience, often

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mt-4">
            As societal trends evolve, so do naming conventions in Hollywood.
            Modern films often feature names that reflect diversity and global
            influences. <strong>Mia</strong> (<strong>Emma Stone</strong> in{" "}
            <strong>&quot;La La Land&quot;</strong>) and <strong>Luna</strong> (
            <strong> Emma Watson</strong> in{" "}
            <strong> &quot;Harry Potter&quot;</strong>) showcase the growing
            popularity of shorter, softer names with international appeal.

            Hollywood also celebrates cultural diversity through names that
            reflect different heritages. <strong>Leia</strong> (
            <strong>Carrie Fisher</strong> in{" "}
            <strong>&quot;Star Wars&quot;</strong>) has become synonymous with
            resilience and leadership, while names like
            <strong> Mulan</strong> (Disney&apos;s animated feature) celebrate
            cultural heroes in a way that resonates worldwide.

            <strong>Emma</strong> continue to grace Hollywood screens across
            generations, embodying versatility and universal appeal.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mt-4">
